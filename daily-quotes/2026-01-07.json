There we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world.

Then the puppy will come back to the fence to lick your fingers again, and you’ll shriek and start laughing again. It will be the most wonderful sound I could ever imagine, a sound that makes me feel like a fountain, or a wellspring.",
